# üõµ Helmet Violation Detection System for Motorcyclist

This project aims to automatically detect helmet violations of motorcyclists in Vietnam using computer vision and deep learning technology. The project helps improve traffic safety by identifying individuals riding without helmets in videos or live streams. We focus on developing the project to be able to meet the practical implementation capabilities of traffic conditions in Vietnam, especially from traffic camera systems.

## System Design

![System Diagram](images/AIP_Architecture.png)

### üì° Camera Streaming Server
IP cameras transmit video data via the **RTSP** protocol to a **Streaming Server**. This server is responsible for distributing video streams on demand to subsequent processing components.



### üñ•Ô∏è Frontend (User Interface)
The **web interface**, developed using **ReactJS**, allows users to:

- Monitor live streams.
- Search for violation events.
- Manage system and user information.

The frontend sends requests to the backend and displays the received responses.



### üß† Backend
The **Backend**, built with the **Django** framework, serves as the core coordinator:

- Receives requests from the frontend.
- Connects to **Redis** and **Database** for data storage and retrieval.
- Receives violation results from the AI Service.
- Interacts with external services such as **Gmail API** and **Stringee**.



### ü§ñ AI API (Artificial Intelligence Service)
The **AI service** is responsible for computer vision tasks:

- **Object Detection (YOLO Ultralytics)**: Detects motorcycles, helmets/no helmets, and license plates.
- **PaddleOCR**: Recognizes motorcycle license plates.
- **ByteTrack**: Tracks objects across consecutive frames.

The AI API receives requests from the backend and returns recognition results.


### üóÉÔ∏è Database
Stores all system-related data, including:

- Violation license plate data and extracted evidence images.
- System information such as locations and cameras.
- User information and access roles.

### üåê External Services
- **Stringee**: Provides voice/SMS call center support for user authentication.
- **Gmail API**: Automatically sends violation notification emails.
- **LangChain**: Assists with extracting information from motorcycle registration certificates.
